# weather_forecast_app

## Description

In this project I created a weather dashboard web app. Its functionality includes an input box to search for a city, then it displays the current weather, and a 5 day forecast. The temperature, high and low temperature, humidity, windspeed and an icon corresponding to weather conditions are displayed. An additional description of the weather and city name that was searched is displayed on the current day weather display. You are able to go through your search history to view the weather conditions of the selected city name from the search history.
